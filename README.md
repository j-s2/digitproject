# Handwritten Digit Classification project

Both the python and jupyter notebook files are provided. The program uses a neural network to classify handwritten digits. The dataset provided includes 100 images for each possible label, so it is smaller than usual MNIST datasets. 

The program outputs the model, the loss for each epoch during the training process, and the accuracy of the model at the end.
